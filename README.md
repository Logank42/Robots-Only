## Game Overview

In this game, you create a character with a unique set of stats based on the class you choose. You will explore a world filled with enemies, powerful items, and a final boss awaiting your challenge. The game is entirely text-based, and each choice you make will impact your survival and success.

## Classes

Choose from three distinct character classes, each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and abilities:

- **Warrior**: High health and strength, low agility. Best suited for direct combat.
- **Mage**: High magic power and moderate dodge chance, but lower health. Uses spells to attack enemies.
- **Rogue**: High agility and dodge chance with balanced health and strength. Excels in dodging and landing attacks swiftly.

## Gameplay

### Combat

When encountering an enemy, you have several choices for each turn:
- **Attack**: Deal physical damage to the enemy based on your character's strength.
- **Defend**: Boost your health slightly by taking a defensive stance.
- **Magic**: Cast a spell for powerful attacks (only available to characters with remaining magic points).

Each enemy also has unique attributes and may dodge attacks.

#### Enemy Types
- **Standard Enemies**: Lower health and attack power; some have a small chance to dodge.
- **Final Boss**: Enhanced stats and unique abilities. Defeating the boss will reward you with a powerful item!

### Items

Throughout the game, you can collect items that boost your character’s abilities, either temporarily or permanently. You can choose to:
- **Use**: Apply the item's effect immediately.
- **Keep**: Save the item for a later time.

Types of items include:
- **Health Boost**: Restores or increases health.
- **Strength Boost**: Enhances physical attack power.
- **Magic Boost**: Increases magic attack potential.
